Effect Component

By: Jacob Withers

	The effects component works by adding effects to the produced sound from the synthesizers
There are 3 effects done in this project and they are; compression, a noise gate and chorus.

	First the compression is done by setting a threshold and if the sound is above that threshold the sound
is compressed to make it sound better. If the sound is below the threshold then nothing is done. This is done to
make volume seem constant. To implement this the score file looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<score bpm="60" beatspermeasure="4">
   <instrument instrument="ToneInstrument">
      <compresssion/>
      <note measure="1" beat="1" duration="1.9" note="C4"/>
      <compressionoff/>

	The second effect is the noise gate which reduces volume of sounds if they do not reach a certain threshold.
This is used to remove hiss and other unwanted noises and is implemented in the score file like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<score bpm="60" beatspermeasure="4">
   <instrument instrument="ToneInstrument">
      <NoiseGate/>
      <note measure="1" beat="1" duration="1.9" note="C4"/>
      <NoiseGateOff/>

	The third and final effect is the  chorus and is done with a short delay being added to the produced audio, it
then reduces the sound of the delay to make it seem as if there is an echo. By adding multiple sounds together the chorus
effect is produced and the score file is implemented like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<score bpm="60" beatspermeasure="4">
   <instrument instrument="ToneInstrument">
      <chorus/>
      <note measure="1" beat="1" duration="1.9" note="C4"/>
      <chorusoff/>

10 - Component passes audio
20 - 1 Effect
30 - 3 Effects


I had issues doing all effects one at a time so they are broken up intoo
CompressionTest.score ChorusTest.score NoiseGateTest.score

The resulting wav files were:
CompressionTest.wav ChorusTest.wav NoiseGateTest.wav
