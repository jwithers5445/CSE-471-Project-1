Additive Synthesizer

By: Jacob Withers

	The additive synthesizer is the first component in my project and does synthesizing 
by adding multiple harmonics together to produce a different sound. To accomplish this
I created a new class called "CAdditive" and depending on information given from the score file
I would add sinewaves together to produce the new sound. I implemented all harmonics by
using a loop until the frequency of the harmonic was over the Nyquist frequency. I also
did envelope generation by using attack, decay, sustain, release in the class "CADSR". To add these 
harmonics to the synthesizer the score file looked like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<score bpm="60" beatspermeasure="4">
   <instrument instrument="Additive">
      <note measure="1" beat="1" duration="1.9" note="C4" harmonics1 = "0.01" harmonics2 = "0.02"/>

10 - Sinusoid playback on demand from the sequencer
20 - Definition of all harmonics
30 - Envelope generation

I was having issues producing the sound I wanted and but believe my code is very close to 
working. 

The score I used for this was:
AdditiveTest.score 

The resulting wav file was:
AdditiveTest.wav
