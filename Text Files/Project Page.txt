Project Page

By: Jacob Withers

The components implemented in this project are:

Additive Synthesizer
Effects Component

The score file I created was the first verse of Eye of the Tiger
and is shown by the score file:
tiger.score

The additive synthesizer was not creating the sound needed for the
song to sound correct so the tone instument synthesizer was used to 
produce the wav file titled:
tiger.wav
